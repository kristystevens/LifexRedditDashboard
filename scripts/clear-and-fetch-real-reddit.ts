I was reassured multiple times that this insurance was legit and there are providers available inn my area (Birmingham, AL). Well now, I am pregnant and I cannot find a facility that is in network. There are many providers listed on their provider search but every place I call is so confused and can't even complete an eligibility check. I called LifeX...they told me to say Multiplan PHCS when asking about in-network coverage...I do that...same results. Did I just get scammed??? LifeX also requested I fill out an I-9 and W-4...but for what???? There is no clear answers on anything and now the agent I purchased from has ghosted every text message I send him. What do I do now?? Did I really get scammed?\n\n",
